Crimson Full-Stack Technical Test 
Front-End
You are provided with a simple webpage design that you should try to reproduce as a functional webpage, view-able on a browser. You can use any UI frameworks, css styles, or anything you want to get the job done. The fastest and most simple way is pure html and css styling. The goal is to get as close to the design requirements as possible and we are mainly judging the visual aspects of the work.

The design: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxPmzD9OMlNUaWJwVGk2d2hGX0E/view

Notes/requirements:

- The blue bar and the black background are meant to go across the width of the screen.
- The nav items should be centered in the top blue bar.
- The Drama nav item shows the selected state. The Factual nav item shows the hover state.
- Each of the Outlander tile should be clickable
- When the user hovers over a tile, the tiles opacity would be changed to 70%. The opacity change should be animated, and would take 0.5 seconds.

When you are done, please email your source code to a.so@crimsoneducation.org and z.lang@crimsoneducation.org.
Please spend up to 40 minutes on this task.
